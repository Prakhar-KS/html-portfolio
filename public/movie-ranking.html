<h1>The Best Movies According to Prakhar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I loved how deep this movies goes regarding space and science. The concept behind this movie is also quite futuristic.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>One more work of Christopher Nolan makes into my list of top 3 movies. It deeply explains the amount of power that a atom bomb has. Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer has done a brilliant role. </p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Its a hindi movie that explains what should be the actual process of learning for the students so that they can excel in their life. I loved how this movie tells the viewers to run after knowledge rather than marks.</p>
